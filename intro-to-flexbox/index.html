            <h3>Draupnir Spear</h3>
            <p>
              The Draupnir Spear is a new weapon added to Kratos' arsenal
               during the Path Quest "Forging Destiny." In this quest,
                Kratos, Freya, and Brok visit the Lady of the Forge in 
                Svartalheim. The Lady crafts the Spear for Kratos, which 
                unlocks new abilities and skills. The Spear is contained 
                in a ring that Kratos wears, and when in use can do a great 
                amount of range and melee damage. It can also self-replicate,
                 meaning you can throw multiple spears at your targets.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll also be able to use the Spear to access areas you 
              haven't been able to get to before. There are marks in stones
               that, when you throw the spear at it, create a step you can 
               climb. The Spear can also destroy rocks and obstacles. When 
               multiple spears are thrown at a target, press (Triangle), 
               and the spears will detonate, destroying the rocks and 
               clearing a path.

            <h3>Blades of Chaos </h3>
            <p>
              The Blades of Chaos are a staple of the God of War franchise 
              and a constant reminder of Kratos' past. These powerful blades
               are bound to his wrists and can deal a massive amount of 
               damage to hordes of enemies in a matter of seconds

            <h3>Shatter Star Shield</h3>
            <p>
              The Shatter Star Shield is a long-range version of the 
              shield. Acting like the Dauntless shield and being a 
              high-risk, high-reward option. Instead of the usual parry, 
              if you double tap L1, you will perform a shield punch which 
              blows enemies backwards.

              The Leviathan Axe is a new addition to the Nordic era of God 
              of War and becomes Kratos' main offensive weapon in the games.
               This powerful weapon is enchanted with the power of ice and
                can be summoned from any distance.
